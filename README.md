# first-nodejs

This is my first attempt at making my own webserver solution using NodeJS. The purpose of the project was to get myself more comfortable with using JavaScript.
The backend was made to serve data for the frontend that can be found here: https://github.com/ignurof/portfolio-frontend

I learned about the domain name system, api routing and endpoints.
What I take with me especially from the project is how much work needs to be done in the future in terms of security measures.
